Once upon a time, i did not want to use any CMS for this site because I knew, that I won&#8217;t create much content. This in general did not change, but the tool i used for creating the static content (<a href="https://github.com/Pawka/phrozn/" target="_blank">Phrozn</a>) sadly has pretty much stopped to be developed. And since it takes less and less effort to manage a <a href="https://wordpress.org/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> installation, I just moved to this solution. It might be possible that I will create more content because it is now dynamic, but no promises!

So stay tuned for eventually more content,
oXi
