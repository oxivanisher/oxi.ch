Once upon a time, i did not want to use any CMS for this site because I knew, that I won't create much content. This in general did not change, but the tool i used for creating the static content ([Phrozn](https://github.com/Pawka/phrozn/)) sadly has pretty much stopped to be developed. And since it takes less and less effort to manage a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) installation, I just moved to this solution. It might be possible that I will create more content because it is now dynamic, but no promises!

So stay tuned for eventually more content,
oXi
