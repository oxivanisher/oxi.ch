### Linux

As a daily user of Linux and as a Linux System Engineer at [T-Systems Alpine](https://www.t-systems.com/), Linux is a essential part of my geek and work life. The only reason I still have a Windows Box, is for Gaming.

### Opensource

OSS is a major part of my live and if ever possible I try to use open software. Also I strongly believe, that open source is a great way to push forward invention. Most of my own development is also OSS and is available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/oxivanisher/).
