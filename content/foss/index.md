### Linux

As a daily user of Linux and as a Linux System Engineer at <a href="https://www.t-systems.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-Systems Alpine</a>, Linux is a essential part of my geek and work life. The only reason I still have a Windows Box, is for Gaming.

### Opensource

OSS is a major part of my live and if ever possible I try to use open software. Also I strongly believe, that open source is a great way to push forward invention. Most of my own development is also OSS and is available on my <a href="https://github.com/oxivanisher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub profile</a>.
