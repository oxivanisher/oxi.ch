Englisch? Ja, da die IT-Themen mehr für ein Internationales Publikum interessant sind, sind diese teilweise in Englisch.

I am hosting some websites, game servers and other things on the internet with my Linux servers only for personal friends or projects. Once there was a list with examples here, but since it was always outdated, I just removed it.

I am using two servers to achieve this. One is a Virtual Machine hosted at <a href="https://www.linode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linode</a>, the other is a physical server at <a href="http://hetzner.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hetzner</a>. To minimize my required effort, I am automating everything that makes sense with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansible_(software)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ansible</a>. Maybe one day I will release my roles on my <a href="https://github.com/oxivanisher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, but I have to clean them up first. This cleanup has a very low priority. 😉

For more than 15 years, I hosted my own mail server. But since the fight against incoming spam and the constant struggle to not be declared as spam for very small providers is enormous, I gave up on this. 🙁
